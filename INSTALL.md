## Local install using Docker

OSPOS can be deployed using Docker on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Locally or on a host (server).
This setup dramatically reduces the number of possible issues as all setup is now done in a Dockerfile.
Docker runs natively on Mac and Linux. Windows requires WSL2 to be installed. Please refer to the Docker documentation for instructions on how to set it up on your platform.

**Be aware that this setup is not suited for production usage! Change the default passwords in the compose file before exposing the containers publicly.**

Start the containers using the following command

```
    docker-compose up
```
